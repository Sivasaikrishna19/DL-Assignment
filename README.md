## Enhanced Model Functions

### ResNet Customization

We've introduced an enhanced function `modify_resnet` that improves flexibility and usability:
- **Model Variants**: Allows the selection of specific ResNet variants such as ResNet18 or ResNet50.
- **Pretrained Weights**: Offers the option to use pretrained weights for quicker convergence.
- **Layer Freezing**: Enables freezing of the early layers, beneficial for transfer learning by retaining pre-trained features.
- **Debug Outputs**: Includes detailed debug outputs to help verify and understand model configuration during setup.

### VGG Customization

The `create_vggmodel1` function has been updated to better support customization and efficient training:
- **Pretrained Model Loading**: Automatically loads a pretrained VGG16 model to leverage pre-learned features.
- **Classifier Adaptation**: Adapts the classifier part of the VGG model to accommodate any specified number of target classes.
- **Layer Freezing**: Freezes all convolutional layers to prevent them from updating during the initial phases of training.
- **Architecture Customization**: Allows easy customization of the model architecture through a configurable list of layers, enhancing adaptability to different datasets and tasks.
